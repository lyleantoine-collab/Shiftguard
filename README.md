# ShiftGuard Lightweight, rotating credential engine. Secure access without ever sharing passwords. Generate, rotate, revoke — all on a timer. ## How it works You feed it a master key. It spits out time-limited access tokens. When the next person's shift starts, the old one dies. Instant revocation. ## Core Service-agnostic. Adapters plug in later (Netflix, GitHub, Spotify — whatever). python from shiftguard import ShiftGuard guard = ShiftGuard(master_token=sk_live_yourkey) # Give Alice access alice = guard.grant_to(Alice, days=30) print(alice.token) # temporary key # Shift it to Bob — Alice's token is toast bob = guard.grant_to(Bob, days=30) print(bob.token) ## License MIT Lyle & Leo. Do what you want. Break it, you buy it.
