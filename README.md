# ShiftGuard Lightweight, rotating credential engine. Keeps secrets safe, hands out access — then snatches it back before anyone blinks. Works for APIs, subscriptions, anything with a token. No password leaks. No endless logins. Just spin the lock. ## Quick start python from shiftguard import ShiftGuard guard = ShiftGuard(master='sk_live_yourkey') token = guard.give_to(Lyle) # gives Lyle a one-month key guard.hand_over_to(Jess) # boom — Lyle's gone, Jess steps in Adapters live in separate folders. Start with Netflix, roll out the rest.
